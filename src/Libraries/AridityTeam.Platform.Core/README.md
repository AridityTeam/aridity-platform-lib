# AridityTeam.Platform.Core
The main core platform library for The Aridity Team projects.

This library contains the core functionalities and abstractions that are shared across various projects within The Aridity Team ecosystem. 
It serves as the foundation for building applications and services that adhere to the team's standards and practices.

Some features are from the old **AridityTeam.Base** library.

## Features
- **Observable Collections**: A collection that provides notifications when items get added, removed, or when the whole list is refreshed.
- **Interface Exposure**: A mechanism to expose interfaces as a (global) variable for dependency injection and service registration.
- **Validation**: A set of validation utilities to ensure data integrity and correctness.
- **Command-line parser**: A parser for command-line arguments that simplifies the process of handling user input.
- **Multi-text writer**: A utility for writing text to multiple outputs simultaneously, such as console and file.
- **Logging**: A logging framework that supports various log levels and output formats, making it easier to track application behavior.
